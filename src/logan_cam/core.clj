;;    so it may be used to move files between machines on different
;;    networks implementing UDP.  (This should not exclude the possibility
;;    of implementing TFTP on top of other datagram protocols.)  It is
;;    designed to be small and easy to implement.  Therefore, it lacks most
;;    of the features of a regular FTP.  The only thing it can do is read
;;    and write files (or mail) from/to a remote server.  It cannot list
;;    directories, and currently has no provisions for user authentication.
;;    In common with other Internet protocols, it passes 8 bit bytes of
;;    data.
;; 
;;    Three modes of transfer are currently supported: netascii (This is
;;    ascii as defined in "USA Standard Code for Information Interchange"
;;    [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>] with the modifications specified in "Telnet Protocol
;;    Specification" [<a href="#ref-3" title="&quot;Telnet Protocol Specification,&quot;">3</a>].)  Note that it is 8 bit ascii.  The term
;;    "netascii" will be used throughout this document to mean this
;;    particular version of ascii.); octet (This replaces the "binary" mode
;;    of previous versions of this document.) raw 8 bit bytes; mail,
;;    netascii characters sent to a user rather than a file.  (The mail
;;    mode is obsolete and should not be implemented or used.)  Additional
;;    modes can be defined by pairs of cooperating hosts.
;; 
;;    Reference [<a href="#ref-4" title="&quot;Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Application and Support&quot;">4</a>] (<a href="#section-4.2">section 4.2</a>) should be consulted for further valuable
;;    directives and suggestions on TFTP.
;; 
;; <span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>. Overview of the Protocol</span>
;; 
;;    Any transfer begins with a request to read or write a file, which
;;    also serves to request a connection.  If the server grants the
;;    request, the connection is opened and the file is sent in fixed
;;    length blocks of 512 bytes.  Each data packet contains one block of
;;    data, and must be acknowledged by an acknowledgment packet before the
;;    next packet can be sent.  A data packet of less than 512 bytes
;;    signals termination of a transfer.  If a packet gets lost in the
;;    network, the intended recipient will timeout and may retransmit his
;;    last packet (which may be data or an acknowledgment), thus causing
;;    the sender of the lost packet to retransmit that lost packet.  The
;;    sender has to keep just one packet on hand for retransmission, since
;;    the lock step acknowledgment guarantees that all older packets have
;;    been received.  Notice that both machines involved in a transfer are
;;    considered senders and receivers.  One sends data and receives
;;    acknowledgments, the other sends acknowledgments and receives data.
;; 
;;    Most errors cause termination of the connection.  An error is
;;    signalled by sending an error packet.  This packet is not
;;    acknowledged, and not retransmitted (i.e., a TFTP server or user may
;;    terminate after sending an error message), so the other end of the
;;    connection may not get it.  Therefore timeouts are used to detect
;;    such a termination when the error packet has been lost.  Errors are
