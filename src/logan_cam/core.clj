        that its name comes, Trivial File Transfer Protocol or TFTP. Each
        nonterminal packet is acknowledged separately. This document describes
        the protocol and its types of packets. The document also explains the
        reasons behind some of the design decisions.")

       (paragraph
        "The protocol was originally designed by Noel Chiappa, and was
        redesigned by him, Bob Baldwin and Dave Clark, with comments from Steve
        Szymanski. The current revision of the document includes modifications
        stemming from discussions with and suggestions from Larry Allen, Noel
        Chiappa, Dave Clark, Geoff Cooper, Mike Greenwald, Liza Martin, David
        Reed, Craig Milo Rogers (of USC-ISI), Kathy Yellick, and the author. The
        acknowledgement and retransmission scheme was inspired by TCP, and the
        error mechanism was suggested by PARC's EFTP abort message.")]]))))
